The code of this project is licensed under [LGPL](LICENSE-CODE). This includes java source code, generated `.json` files, and `.class` files in the built `.jar`.

The art of this project is by JoeFly and is [ARR](LICENSE-ART). This includes `.png` texture files, as well as the translations in [`lang`](src/main/resources/assets/tooltrims/lang).

Because the built `.jar` contains art files, the `.jar` as a whole is considered ARR. However, it can freely be used in Modrinth modpacks.
