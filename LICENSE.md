The code of this project is licensed under [LGPL](LICENSE-CODE). This includes java source code, generated `.json` files, and `.class` files in the built `.jar`.

The art of this project is by JoeFly and is [ARR](LICENSE-ART). This includes `.png` texture files, as well as the translations in [`lang`](src/main/resources/assets/tooltrims/lang).

The [enchancement compat assets](src/main/resources/resourcepacks/enchancement/assets/tooltrims/textures/item/enchancement) were created for the mod Enchancement by doctor4t and cybercat5555 and are [ARR](LICENSE-ART). They were modified and used with permission.

Because the built `.jar` contains art files, the `.jar` as a whole is considered ARR. However, it can freely be used in Modrinth modpacks.
